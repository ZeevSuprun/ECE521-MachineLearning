# ECE521-MachineLearning

This git repository contains the coursework for the three assignments from the course Inference Algorithms and Machine Learning

## Assignment 1
In this assignment, we used the k Nearest Neighbours algorithm to make predictions for regression (on a randomly generated sample data set) and classification (on the FaceScrub dataset).

## Assignment 2
In this assignment, we used linear and logistic regression to make predictions on the 2 class notMNIST dataset, which is a dataset containing training and test images of the letters C and J in various typefaces, and multi-class logistic regression to make predictions on the FaceScrub dataset.

## Assignment 3
In this assignment, a neural network was used to make predictions on the full (10 class / the letters A - J) notMnist dataset. Various values for the number of hidden layers, number of hidden units, dropout rate, mini batch size, and other hyperparameters were tested. The best hyperparameters found yielded an accuracy of 92% on the test set.
